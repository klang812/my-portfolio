# *My Portfolio*

#### *My Portfolio for Epicodus, 1.8.2021*

#### *By Kerry Lang*

## Description
_This project was intended to test my knowledge using html and git commands. For example I implemented tags (h, p, ul, ol, li, em, strong, a, div and span), made sure my code is clean and easy to read and made commits regularly to Github_

## Behavior

## Setup
* _Clone the repository_
* _To do this you need go to your terminal_
* _In the terminal go to your desktop directory_
* _Create a directory (mkdir 'name of choice') and once inside type 'git clone' and link the url from this site to your terminal_
* _Be sure that you are not cloning a project inside of an existing local repository. In other words, you should not be inside of a project directory when you run the git clone command. Otherwise you'll end up with one git repository inside of another._
* _Next type cd and the name of the project in this case my-portfolio (cd my-portfolio)_
* _Lastly type code ._
