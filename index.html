    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I am an aspiring developer with a passion for <span style="color:red">solving problems</span> and helping others <span style="color:red">find solutions!</span></li>
      <li>Work hard and play hard is the name of the game!  My passions include most anything outdoors including fly fishing, skiing, biking, hiking and more!</li>
      <li>I also love to cook and entertain.  I have heard many times, <em>"You should open a restaurant!"</em></li>  And yes I have a pandemic sourdough starter!
    </ul>
    <h2>My Background</h2>
    <p>Most of my past experience is in the Account Management field.  Some of the industries I have worked in include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Beer and Wine</li>
      <li>Industrial</li>
      <li>Hospitality</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Where you will find me on the weekend....</h2>
    <p>While my wife would say I should just pick one hobby, I think that's boring ;).  I have a lot of passions and probably too many to count.  But if I have to pick maybe 5 they would be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fly Fishing</li>
      <li>Biking</li>
      <li>Cooking, which includes BBQ, smoking meats, curing my own bacon and trying to make copycat recipes of our favorite dishes/snacks.</li>
      <li>Skiing</li>
      <li>All sports, including many a yard game!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Coding?</h2>
    <p>Why Not?!</p>
    <p>Just Kidding!  To think my career would be to solve puzzles and perhaps help people make their lives easier or better, whether thru an application or a program, excites me.  I am very much a people person and would love to make a difference.</p>
